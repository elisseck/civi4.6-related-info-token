# civi4.6-related-info-token
Drupal 7 module adding custom tokens to civiCRM 4.6.4 to grab data through a relationship link.

How this might be useful to you:

If you need to send civiMail to individuals, for example, but merge token information held in their organization or household record (or 
through any custom relationship), you can use this module to do so. 

This is built specifically for our custom fields and relationships, but just replace our field names, field IDs, relationship IDs with your own. 
You can also add more api chains to the call for data from additonal tables etc.
